This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a kinda Spotify clone where people can listen to music. It is built using Next.js,Prisma, and Heroku for the database. For styling, I have used Chakra UI.
